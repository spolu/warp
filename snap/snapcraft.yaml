summary: Secure and simple terminal sharing

  warp lets you securely share your terminal with one simple command:

  warp open

  When connected to your warp, clients can see your terminal exactly
  as if they were sitting next to you. You can also grant them write
  access, the equivalent of handing them your keyboard.
